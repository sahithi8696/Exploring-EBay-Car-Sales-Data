# Exploring-EBay-Car-Sales-Data
In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website
The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings

Data Cleaning
a. We clean the column names for them to be more readable and appropriate
b. Drop some of the columns that contain mostly one value
c. We convert the values in some columns that are stored as strings into numeric values which will help us in further analysis
d. Removing outlier data points (that do not stand the test of reasonability) by checking values in specific columns
e. Converting German words into English in some of the columns
f. 

Data Analysis
a. Find the most popular brands i.e brands that account for atleast 5% of the total listings
b. Explore how the mean price changes with brands and price gaps bewteen different brands 
c. Explore how the mean milage changes with brands and gaps in milage between different brands
d. Find the most popular brand - model combination
e. See if non-damaged cars were sold at higher prices than the damaged cars listed and study the price gap
f. Exploring the relationship between average prices and average milage
