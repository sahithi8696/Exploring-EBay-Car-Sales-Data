# Exploring-EBay-Car-Sales-Data

- In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website
- The aim of this project is to perform data cleaning on the data and analyze the included used car listings

## Data Cleaning
- We clean the column names for them to be more readable and appropriate
- Drop some of the columns that contain mostly one value
- We convert the values in some columns that are stored as strings into numeric values which will help us in further analysis
- Removing outlier data points (that do not stand the test of reasonability) by checking values in specific columns
- Converting German words into English in some of the columns 

## Data Analysis
- Find the most popular brands i.e brands that account for atleast 5% of the total listings
- Explore how the mean price changes with brands and price gaps bewteen different brands 
- Explore how the mean milage changes with brands and gaps in milage between different brands
- Find the most popular brand - model combination
- See if non-damaged cars were sold at higher prices than the damaged cars listed and study the price gap
- Exploring the relationship between average prices and average milage
